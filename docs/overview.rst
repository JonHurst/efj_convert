Overview
========

This is a set of command line tools for working with electronic Flight Journal
(eFJ) files. A :ref:`graphical front end<gui>` to these command line tools is
also provided for those that prefer.

An eFJ file is a just a text file that contains personal flight data. It has a
simple, intuitive scheme that is easy to work with for both humans and
computers. A full description of this scheme can be found at
https://hursts.org.uk/efjdocs/format.html.

The tools fall into two categories: :ref:`tools to modify an eFJ
file<Modification>` and :ref:`tools to convert one into other useful
formats<Convert>`. The latter category includes the ability to generate an
FCL.050 compliant logbook and a set of summary tables, both as simple,
standalone HTML files that can be viewed in any web browser or processed further
using spreadsheets, word processors, PDF converters etc.
